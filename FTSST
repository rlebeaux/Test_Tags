**Type of Measure:**  Five Times Sit to Stand Test (FTSST or 5xSST) evaluates lower limb muscle strength by timing how long it takes the patient to sit down from a chair and stand up five times. It can be used to measure how capable patients are at transitional movements.

**Target Population:** Adults and elderly adults 18 or over with movement impairments including cerebral palsy, Parkinson's disease, vestibular disorders, and a history of stroke.

**Measurement properties and previous use:** 

The validation sample was divided into two dichotomous groups based on performance of behaviors generally agreed upon as reflecting self-determination. Analyses indicated that, on measures of each of the four essential characteristics, there were significant differences between individuals who engaged in behaviors reflecting self-determination and those who did not. Construct validity was further assessed via several factor analyses (see [Wehmeyer's (1995) procedural guidelines manual](http://www.thearc.org/document.doc?id=3671) for detailed review).
